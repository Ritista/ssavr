                With Simple.Savr, all you have to do is copy & paste your text into Simple.
                Savr, or upload files, and visit Simple.Savr from any device that is under the same WiFi network.

                No more emailing yourself a file to get it to another device
                No more memorizing that long URL to open it on another computer
                No more copying that file using a USB just to get that text or file over to another device.

                After uploading files or saving your savr from one device, your data will be waiting for you from 
                all your devices.

                <h1>WORKS ON ALL PLATFORM</h1>
                <p>Simple.Savr works on all platforms. Our responsive design makes everything clean and very simple.

                <h1>PASSWORD PROTECTION</h1>
                <p>You can protect your savr using a password. This way, if someone else get's on your WiFi network, they can't see your savr, uploaded files and settings.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>100% ENCRYPTED</h1>
                <p>Even we can't see what you have typed. That's how secure your savr is. Your savr is encrypted using your IP and an encryption text that is randomly generated which you can override by providing your own.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>UPLOAD FILES</h1>
                <p>You can now upload and sync files automatically across all your devices. No more emailing that document to your other computer just to print it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>LINK MULTIPLE IPS</h1>
                <p>Do the computers on your network have two different IPs? Not a problem, just add tha IP address from settings and active it from a device that is under the IP you just added. There you go, now you have multiple IPs synced together!

                <h1>DISABLE ADS</h1>
                <p>We don't like ads either. No one does. Except advertisers and of course, Google. That's why we give you the option to remove them from your settings. If you disable ads, it will be disabled from all your devices.
